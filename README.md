# Pandas-Homework
In this assignment, I have evaluated the performance of various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compared them against the S&amp;P 500 by looking at areas like volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. I have used quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas.   

Additionally, a custom portfolio of stocks were created and I compared its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&amp;P 500).
